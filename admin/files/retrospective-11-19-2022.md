after having a discussion with us we notice the app will never be used on the webpage on the computer (no one will carry his computer to brew a coffee so this app is mostly designed to be on a phone) so the team decided to scratch all the work done to represent the webpage and change it to make it look like the phone so we divide the objective to the following

- Sarkis will use his previous class's study techniques and tools to make the Figma wireframe mobile look into functional pages in making place holder arbitrary some divs and spans and copying the CSS from the Figma to each page we intend to do in the project
- From this point on each will work on the section they are familiar with so far (the section that each was working on during the past run)
- Alex will connect all the pages and activate the back button on each page
- Kenry will work on timer view (countdown) 
- Pratyush Sahu on the timer edit 
- Dante saves the recipe and making activities for the assignment
- Eric Tran saves recipe edit
- Daniel Ziper check if something missing edit if necessary create issues for each 
- Kyrell Ringpis assist Date and Eric to save the recipe we need to be an able catch all the files and save them locally
- Derek Zhu populating  the save recipe in the home page
- Ella work on the video assignment that is due Monday
