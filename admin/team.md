1. Dante\
Hey I'm Dante and I'm a senior student majoring in computer science. I'm a big fan of full-stack development! My favorite toolkits to use are ReactJS for the front-end and Typescript and PostgreSql for the backend and database! Some programming languages that I use are Python, Java, C++ and C. When I'm not coding, you could find me either going out for a culinary adventure because I love trying new cuisines out or playing my favorite video games!\

I'm not that heavy on the caffeine side, but when I do want caffeine I like some Vietnamese Iced Coffee. Find more about me on my [Github](https://e7tran.github.io/)
8. Hi, I'm Kenry, and I am a second year Computer Science major. I like sports and exploring interesting problems. On weekend, I may go hiking with friends or just play video games. I like Mocha, because it's sweet! I hope we all can find the sweetness in the bitterness! Check me out on [Github](https://github.com/Kenry3)!
9.  Kyrell\
Hey everyone! My name is Kyrell Ringpis, and I'm a 4th year Math-CS student who loves food, Badminton, Basketball, and video games. I am honestly not a very good programmer, but whatever knowledge, skills, and experience I have lies mostly in Java, C++, and C. When it comes to caffeine, it is something like a best friend and worst enemy. I try not to have caffeine because I get super anxious and jittery and nauseous, but it ultimately helps me stay up and complete important work when I feel too tired to continue. Find a small amount of that work on my [Github](https://kyrellr.github.io/)!
10.  Pratyush
Hello everyone! My name is Pratyush Sahu, and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student in Revelle College. I have a range of interests, from sports such as tennis and badminton to playing video games and reading sci-fi novels. I love Computer Science and Technology in general, and have experience in Java, Python, C++, and C. My favourite caffeine drink has to be just a nice, regular freshly brewed coffee, early in the morning. Find out more about me on [Github](https://github.com/psahu401)!
